What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~
 PChat is an IRC client for Windows and UNIX operating systems. I.R.C. is
 Internet Relay Chat, see http://irchelp.org for more information about IRC
 in general. PChat runs on most BSD and POSIX compliant operating systems.


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * GTK+ 2.10
 * GLib 2.12

 PChat is known to work on, at least:

 * Windows XP/Vista/7/8
 * Linux
 * FreeBSD
 * OpenBSD
 * NetBSD
 * Solaris
 * AIX
 * IRIX
 * DEC/Compaq Tru64 UNIX
 * HP-UX 10.20 and 11
 * MacOS X


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
 --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.


Python Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for XChat 1.8.x are not compatible, a brand new interface has been
 written. The documentation can be found here:

 https://bitbucket.org/ZachThibeau/pchat-dev

 Consider using the Python interface for your scripts, it's a very nice
 API, allows for loading/unloading individual scripts, and gives you
 almost all the features of the C-Plugin API.


Perl Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Perl 5.8 or newer is required. The documentation can be found here:

 https://bitbucket.org/ZachThibeau/pchat-dev

 Scripts for XChat 1.8.x are compatible with the following exceptions:

 * IRC::command will not interpret %C, %B, %U etc.

 * user_list and user_list_short:
  If a user has both op and voice, only the op flag will be 1.

 * add_user_list/sub_user_list/clear_user_list
  These functions do nothing.

 * notify_list
  Not implemented. Always returns an empty list.

 * server_list
  Lists servers that are not connected aswell.

 * Some print events may have new names and some were added.

 * Text printed by scripts must now be UTF8.

 * Text passed to scripts (via add_message_handler) will be encoded in UTF8.


Autoloading Scripts and Plugins:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The root of your PChat config is:

 * Windows: %APPDATA%\PChat
 * Unix: ~/.config/Pchat

 Referred to as <config> from now. PChat automatically loads, at startup:

 * <config>/addons/*.lua Lua scripts
 * <config>/addons/*.pl Perl scripts
 * <config>/addons/*.py Python scripts
 * <config>/addons/*.tcl Tcl scripts
 * <config>/addons/*.dll Plugins (Windows)
 * <config>/addons/*.so Plugins (Unix)


Control Codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 %%     -  A single percentage sign
 %C     -  Control-C (mIRC color code)
 %B     -  Bold Text
 %U     -  Underline Text
 %R     -  Reverse Text
 %O     -  Reset all Text attributes
 %XXX   -  ASCII XXX (where XXX is a decimal 3 digit number)
           (Eg: %007 sends a BEEP)

 %Cforeground,background will produce a color code, eg: %C03,10

 These are now disabled by default (see Settings > Prefs > Input Box).
 Instead you can insert the real codes via ctrl-k, ctrl-b and ctrl-o.
